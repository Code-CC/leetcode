package array

/***

An Array is a collection of items.
The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, booksâ€”anything really.
The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations.
Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.

/***

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Note:

The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000
